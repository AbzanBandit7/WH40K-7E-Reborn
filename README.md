Warhammer 40,000
================

__Notice__: _However we don't support the 6th Edition, all the files in their last revisions for 6th are available [here](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k/releases/tag/v3.1.4). Downloading .bsr file (green button) and importing it in BattleScribe_ __won't__ _mess with 7th ed files._

__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._
